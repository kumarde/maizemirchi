					<h2> About Us </h2>
					<p class = "about">Maize Mirchi is the University of Michigan's premier (and only, but mostly premier) South Asian A Cappella group! We sing a blend of Indian, Western and fusion music. In the a cappella tradition, all of our music is made without instruments, and all of our arrangements are unique and student-written. Our membership consists of undergraduate and graduate students with a variety of musical experience ranging from classical Indian and Western choral training to "Hey, I sound pretty good in the shower."</p><br><br>

					<p class = "about">Founded in 2007 by Suresh Mohan and Arvind Narayanan, Mirchi has since performed at such events as the University of Michigan IASA Show (the largest student-run production in the nation), Dandia Dhamaka (an intercollegiate Raas-Garba competition) and more. We are also active in the UM a cappella community and enjoy performing at yearly events.</p><br><br>

					<p class = "about">We are proud to have placed second two years in row at Gathe Raho, the nationwide South Asian A Cappella contest held at the University of Iowa. We have also put on two successful concerts and are looking forward to delighting crowds every Spring.</p><br><br>

					<p class = "about">Mirchi auditions for new members are held every Fall, and we look forward to hearing you soon! As always, we appreciate your continued support!</p><br><br>
